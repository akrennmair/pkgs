Introduction
------------

I primarily use Fink to install and update commandline and text terminal
software on Mac OS X. However, there are some packages that aren't in the
repository. Since I always found Fink to be too unpleasant to develop for, I
use a patched version of pkgutils (as used by CRUX, the Linux distribution) to
manage these additional packages.

In this repository, you can find both the patch to pkgutils and the package
information to build some packages by yourself. To bootstrap the whole thing,
just execute manually what is done in the pkgutils Pkgfile.

After doing this, you may also want to add this to your ~/.bash_profile or
~/.zshrc:

	export MANPATH=$MANPATH:/usr/pkg/man
	export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=$PKG_CONFIG_PATH:/usr/pkg/lib/pkgconfig
	export PATH=$PATH:/usr/pkg/bin

Please be aware that it is assumed that you already have a working Fink
installation.
